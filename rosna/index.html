<p>Machine Learning is a concept which allows the machine to learn from examples and experience,
and that too without being explicitly programmed. So instead of you writing the code,what you do
is you feed data to the generic algorithm, and the algorithm/ machine builds the logic based on the given data.
Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which focuses mainly on machine learning from their
experience and making predictions based on its experience.It enables the computers or the machines to make
data-driven decisions rather than being explicitly programmed for carrying out a certain task. These programs
or algorithms are designed in a way that they learn and improve over time when are exposed to new data.</p>

<li>When new input data is introduced to the ML algorithm, it makes a prediction on the basis of the model.</li><br>
<li>The prediction is evaluated for accuracy and if the accuracy is acceptable, the Machine Learning algorithm is deployed.</li><br>

<li><h2><b> Supervised Machine Learning</b></h2></li></div>
<div class="style2">
<p>Supervised Learning is the one, where you can consider the learning is guided by a teacher. We have a dataset which
acts as a teacher and its role is to train the model or the machine. Once the model gets trained it can start making a
prediction or decision when new data is given to it.</p>
</div>

<div class="style">
<li><h2><b> Unsupervised Machine Learning</b></h2></li></div>
<div class="style2">
<p>The model learns through observation and finds structures in the data. Once the model is given a dataset, it
automatically finds patterns and relationships in the dataset by creating clusters in it. </p>
</div>

<div class="style">
<li><h2><b> Reinforcement Machine Learning</b></h2></li></div>
<div class="style2">
<p>Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions. It works this way: the machine is
exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. This machine learns from
past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions. Example
of Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Process</p>
